# A tracker of trackers: COVID-19 policy responses and data <!-- omit in toc --> 

The amount of COVID-19 related research being produced within the first
weeks following the implementation far-reaching lockdowns across the
globe has been impressive. I have compiled a collection of policy
trackers and datasets on the topic. The compilation is not meant to be
exhaustive and I am grateful for general feedback or suggestions on new
sources you may have. Please email me at <lukas.lehner@spi.ox.ac.uk>.

This collection started initially as a [Twitter
Thread](https://twitter.com/LukasLehner_/status/1243557931888578565) in
March 2020 and is based on a collaborative effort with suggestions from
